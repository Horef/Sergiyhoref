# Sergiy Horef
Hello, and thank you for coming to this github page.
This repo was created for me (mostly) to be able to store information or ideas that would otherwise be hard to backup.
It will have a list of all the apps I use on my devices, and possibly some mechanisms or algorithms that have no immediate place of upload.
If you are reading this, and you are not Sergiy Horef, you could possibly use this repo as a template to become one. (At least in a very shallow non-private sense.)

## Mac apps

## Fiction Books
